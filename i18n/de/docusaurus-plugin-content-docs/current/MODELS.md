# Chat Models

In the `models` directory we maintain projects that supply a ChatModelProvider.

## Contributing

We are open to support more ChatModels from any provider. If you miss your
preferred one, simply contribute it to this space.

Create a directory `models/smart-workflow-PROVIDER`, replacing PROVIDER with
your concrete vendor. For the project coordinates, please align to our existing
workspace:

```xml
<groupId>com.axonivy.utils.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>smart-workflow-PROVIDER</artifactId>
  <packaging>iar</packaging>
```

Make sure to include your project in the build by adding your provider in the
main [module build](../pom.xml).

## Implementation

Implement your custom
[ChatModelProvider](../smart-workflow/src/com/axonivy/utils/smart/workflow/model/spi/ChatModelProvider.java)
within your project.

You need to register your implementation in a file:
`src/META-INF/services/com.axonivy.utils.smart.workflow.model.spi.ChatModelProvider`
The file must contain a single line, stating your implementation type name.

## Variables

Every provider has its own set of variables. Please contribute your ChatModel
provider variables to the `Variables.AI.Providers.PROVIDER`.

```yaml
Variables:
  AI:
    Providers:
      PROVIDER:
        #[password]
        APIKey: ${decrypt:}
        ...
```

Your custom `variables.yaml` should also be copied and listed into the README.md
setup description, that invites users to use this provider.

Furthermore, please enrich the global enumeration of available providers
[variables.yaml](../smart-workflow/config/variables.yaml) to list your provider.
See the enumeration called `AI.DefaultProvider`.

### Checklist

- [ ] custom variables.yaml in your provider
- [ ] list your provider in `AI.DefaultProvider` of
  [variables.yaml](../smart-workflow/config/variables.yaml)
- [ ] list your model in the Model section of the product
  [README.md](../smart-workflow-product/README.md)
- [ ] extend the product [build](../smart-workflow-product/pom.xml) to
  interpolate your variables into README.md

## File Extraction Support

| Provider         | Model(s)                                                               | PNG / JPEG | PDF |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-: |
| **OpenAI**       | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-5`           |     ✓      |  ✓  |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Any vision-capable deployment (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1` family)        |     ✓      |  ✓  |
| **Gemini**       | All models (`gemini-1.5-*`, `gemini-2.0-*`, `gemini-2.5-*`)            |     ✓      |  ✓  |
| **xAI**          | All `grok-4-1-*` models                                                |     ✓      |  —  |
| **Anthropic**    | All models (`claude-opus-*`, `claude-sonnet-*`, `claude-haiku-*`)      |     ✓      |  ✓  |
| **Ollama**       | Vision-capable models only (`llava`, `llama3.2-vision`, `gemma3`, ...) |     ✓      |  —  |

**Note for Azure OpenAI**: file extraction capability depends on the underlying
model of your deployment, not the deployment name itself. Make sure your
deployment uses a vision-capable model.

**Note for xAI**: PDF files are not natively supported by the xAI API. To
process PDFs with Grok models, convert them to images first before passing them
to Axon Ivy Smart Workflow.

**Note for Anthropic**: Images and PDFs can be sent via URL or base64-encoded
data, both supporting text extraction and visual understanding (charts,
diagrams, layouts).

**Note for Ollama**: Image support requires a vision-capable model to be pulled
(e.g. `ollama pull llava`); text-only models will reject image input. PDFs are
not natively supported — convert them to images first.

When contributing a new provider, document its multimodal support in this table.

### Payload Size Limits

File content is base64-encoded before being sent to the provider. The limits
below apply to the encoded payload and vary by provider. There is no size cap
enforced by Axon Ivy Smart Workflow itself — developers are responsible for
ensuring files stay within the bounds of their chosen provider.

## Libraries

Smart-workflow providers are built upon existing LangChain4j providers. Please
exclude dependencies from your `pom.xml`, which are already part of
smart-workflow. Classically this will be the `langchain4j-core` and
`langchain4j-http-client`

## Testing

Tests for your model provider should be written in the common
`smart-workflow-test` project. Provider specific functionality should be
enclosed in `src_test/com/axonivy/utils/smart/workflow/model/PROVIDER`.

Therefore it's ok to add a dependency from the common test project to your new
model provider.

## Demo

We expect all providers to work in the same manner, therefore no extra
demonstration process needs to be added in the demo project.

Do not add dependencies to additional model providers to the
`smart-workflow-demo` project.
